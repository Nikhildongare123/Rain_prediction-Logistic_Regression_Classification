# 🌧️ Rain Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether it will rain or not based on weather conditions using a Machine Learning Logistic Regression model.

The model is trained on weather-related features such as Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Cloud Cover, and Pressure.

A Streamlit web application is also developed to allow users to make real-time rain predictions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Weather forecasting is important for agriculture, transportation, event planning, and disaster management.

The goal of this project is to predict rainfall using historical weather parameters.
